# OrderedArrayList
Basic summary of what my group talked about in the breakout rooms:
- The beginning was probably the hardest part bc we were trying to figure out how to get started. At first, we tried to make an array list of T. However, we thought that we could not import anything so tried thinking of some other way to do that. We eventually realized that we had to import ArrayList.
- We read through the class notes together and realized that  we could use super.
- Then, we thought it was a good idea to have an extra method like you had suggested.
